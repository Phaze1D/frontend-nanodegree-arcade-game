# Classic Arcade Game Clone
> Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Project 5

This project is a simple implementation of the class arcade game Frogger. Building a game is an excellent way to learn Object Oriented Design (OOD) because we can think of every object in the game world as an Class when coding our game. This project teaches us how to use OOD in Javascript to create clean and maintainable code.

## Development
The game was built with the HTML canvas element and uses the `requestAnimationFrame` method for the game loop. There are two main game objects, the Player and the Enemy. Both objects inherit from the Entity object that contains the common properties like the position and the sprite image of the object.

To get the game up and running just follow these steps
